                    The term "coffee crema" also refers to a long espresso drink, popular since the 1980s in Switzerland and northern Italy. 
                    It is generally served as the standard "café traditionnel" in Belgium.
                    It is produced by running 180–240 millilitres (6.3–8.4 imp fl oz; 6.1–8.1 US fl oz) of water when brewing an espresso, primarily by using a coarser grind.
                    It is similar to a caffè Americano or a long black, except that these latter are diluted espresso, and consist of making ("pulling") a normal (short) espresso shot and combining it with hot water. 
                    By contrast, a coffee crema extracts differently, and thus has a different flavor profile.

                          Outside of Italy, cappuccino is a coffee drink that today is typically composed of a single espresso shot and hot milk, with the surface topped with foamed milk. 
                          Cappuccinos are most often prepared with an espresso machine.
                          The espresso is poured into the bottom of the cup, followed by a similar amount of hot milk, which is prepared by heating and texturing the milk using the espresso machine steam wand. 
                          The top third of the drink consists of milk foam; this foam can be decorated with artistic drawings made with the same milk, called latte art.

                                Latte macchiato is the means of preparing a coffee drink that is mostly milk with a hint of espresso and it directly translates as stained milk as it is made by “staining” the milk with espresso.
                                It is distinctly different from a cafe latte because in a latte macchiato, espresso is added to milk and in a caffe latte, milk is added to espresso. 
                                Latte macchiato also has much more foam and only has around a half or even less of the espresso proportion.
                                Also, latte macchiato is a layered drink which means you can see and observe the divisions of the ingredients rather than the usual homogenous mixture of a latte.

                                      An Americano is an espresso drink made with hot water and espresso, also called a Caffe Americano. 
                                      The drink can be made with either one or two shots of espresso, and varying ratios of water. 
                                      Diluting the strong dark espresso roast brings the flavor closer to a drip coffee: which might be where the name originated! 
                                      The exact origin of the term is murky, but it’s thought to have originated in the 1970’s. 
                                      “Americano” means American in Italian or Spanish, referring to the coffee’s strength being closer to an American-style drip coffee.
